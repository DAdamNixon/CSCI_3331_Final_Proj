## User Guide <br>
- This system has two views; the Login view and the Main view. The Login view allows a user to Login to a preexisting account or close the application. Once logged in, the user is taken to the Main view. Here, the user is shown a search bar, a list of available items, a cart, and a checkout window. Within the main view, the user can add zero to many of each item to their cart. Once items are added to the cart, the checkout window updates respectively. Furthermore, the user has the ability to remove specific items from the cart, or remove the cart entirely. Additionally, the user can place an order. Placing an order will write to a csv file to keep track of placed orders.
